# Spotify Song Analysis Project

In this project, we analyzed multiple attributes of popular Spotify songs, such as popularity score, release year, tempo, danceability, and more. Below are the results of the analysis questions presented in our proposal.

---

## 1. Is there a significant correlation between a song’s attributes (tempo, danceability, and loudness) among the most popular songs (popularity > 75)?

Our findings revealed very weak, negative correlations for all three attributes:

- **Tempo**: Correlation of **-0.3**
- **Danceability**: Correlation of **-0.0001**
- **Loudness**: Correlation of **-0.06**

These results indicate that none of the attributes have a meaningful or statistically significant relationship with a song’s popularity.

## 2. Are there similarities in trends across attributes and popularity of songs?

- **Danceability** most closely followed the upward trend in popularity, particularly between **2020-2024**.
- Tempo also showed similar trends during this period.

This suggests that songs with higher danceability are more likely to be popular.

## 3. How has the average popularity score per year changed over time?

The average popularity score per year fluctuated over time, with notable increases in recent years:

- From **2018 to 2024**, popularity rose significantly, reaching its peak in **2024 at 78.76**.

This increase suggests a trend of growing song popularity in the most recent time range.

## 4. Which attributes (danceability, energy, loudness, tempo) have changed the most between 2000-2019 and 2020-2024?

The attributes that changed the most are:

- **Tempo**: Increased by **2.84**
- **Loudness**: Increased by **0.56**

**Energy** and **danceability** remained almost unchanged.

This suggests that modern music has become **faster** and **louder** while maintaining consistent energy and danceability levels.
